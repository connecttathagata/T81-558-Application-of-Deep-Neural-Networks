# T81-558-Application-of-Deep-Neural-Networks

This repository contains code that I wrote for the Application of Deep Neural Networks class taught by Dr. Jeff Heaton. It contains 10 homework assignments and two projects. 

The first project is a Kaggle competition for our class of 25 students "Predicting the price of Office Supplies".

The final project uses the Glass Identification Data Set from the University of California Irvine, Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification.
