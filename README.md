# T81-558-Application-of-Deep-Neural-Networks

This repository contains code for two projects for the Application of Deep Neural Networks class at Washington University in St. Louis taught by Dr. Jeff Heaton. 

The first project is a Kaggle competition for our class of 25 students "Predicting the price of Office Supplies". https://www.kaggle.com/c/wustl-t81-558-washu-deep-learning-spring-2018. I use a combination of xgboost,LightGBM Regressor and Gradientboost.

The final project uses the Glass Identification Data Set from the University of California Irvine, Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification. I use a Deep learning based classifier with 5 fold cross validation.
